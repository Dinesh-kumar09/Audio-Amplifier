# Audio Amplifier – Mini Project

## Overview
This mini project is about designing and building a **basic audio amplifier**. The aim of the project is to amplify low-level audio signals so that they can be heard clearly through a speaker. The project covers the complete process from circuit design to PCB fabrication and testing.

## Objective
- To design a simple audio amplifier circuit  
- To understand the working of IC-based audio amplifiers  
- To get hands-on experience with PCB design and hardware assembly  

## Tools Used
- EasyEDA (for schematic design, simulation, and PCB layout)
- PCB fabrication and soldering tools
- Basic electronic components (resistors, capacitors, amplifier IC)

## Project Description
The circuit was first designed and simulated using **EasyEDA** to check the output and ensure proper amplification. After successful simulation, a PCB layout was created and fabricated. The components were then soldered onto the PCB and tested using an audio input source and speaker.

The amplifier was able to amplify weak audio signals and produce a clear output with low noise. Proper component selection and layout helped in reducing distortion.

## Results
- Audio signal amplification was successful  
- Output was clear and stable  
- Circuit worked as expected during testing  

## What I Learned
- Basics of audio amplifier circuits  
- Schematic design and simulation  
- PCB layout and fabrication process  
- Practical hardware testing and debugging
